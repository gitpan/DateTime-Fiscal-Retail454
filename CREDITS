The API was inspired by the parent module DateTime.  The source for DateTime
was reviewed numerous times to gleen ideas for implementation techniques and
to insure compatibility.

This module is indebted to the all of the work that has previously gone into
DateTime and the associated modules it depends upon.

Kudos to the National Retail Federation for granting persmission to reference
their webiste in the module's documentaiton for details on the
Retail 4-5-4 calendar.  The NRF was very helpful with details on how
merchants deal with years in the calendar that have 53 weeks.
